# Falihax OWASP Hackathon

[**Full vulnerability and solution list now released!**](VULNS.md)

## Premise
Falihax is a brand new, 100%* real and secure banking company. Last year, they
contracted a group of computer science students to build a website for them -
unfortunately, none of these students
were [CyberSoc](https://cybersoc.org.uk/?r=falihax) members and so didn't know
how to build a web app securely.

Recently, they have experienced a number of
attacks on their website. They are insistent that their website is very safe and
not at all vulnerable, but nevertheless they have asked you to help them improve
their security!

**percentage expressed in binary. 4% margin of error.*

## Task
Download or fork this repository, and try to find as many security vulnerabilites
as possible and fix them!
